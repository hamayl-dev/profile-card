Today I built an Interactive Profile Card ðŸŽ¨âœ¨ â€” a small but fun project that really helped me understand how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript come together to create dynamic user interfaces.

ðŸ’¡ The card includes:

A clean layout made with Flexbox

Interactive buttons that toggle themes and details

Smooth transitions using CSS effects

A round background element for aesthetic design ðŸŽ¯

This isnâ€™t a portfolio website yet â€” just a landing-style mini project to sharpen my frontend skills (ignore the pictures ðŸ˜…).

Every day Iâ€™m learning something new, and seeing even small UI elements come to life keeps me motivated to keep going. ðŸ’ª
